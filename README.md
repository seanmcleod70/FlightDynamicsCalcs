# Flight Dynamics Calcs
Calculations, simulations with JSBSim and write up with [marimo](https://marimo.io/) notebooks.

Static html snapshots of each marimo notebook can be found in the `docs` directory and via Github
Pages at [Flight Dynamics Calcs](https://seanmcleod70.github.io/FlightDynamicsCalcs/).

## Roll Performance

#### [A4 Skyhawk Roll Performance](https://github.com/seanmcleod70/FlightDynamicsCalcs/blob/main/A4%20Skyhawk%20Roll%20Performance.py)
Can the A4 really roll at 720 deg/s or is it a tall tale? Using some aerodynamic data published by NASA letâ€™s take a look.

#### [Fighter Roll Rates](https://github.com/seanmcleod70/FlightDynamicsCalcs/blob/main/Fighter%20Roll%20Rates.py)
Comparing fighter roll rates based on published aerodynamic data.

## Aircraft Carrier

#### [Aircraft Carrier Flight Path Angles](https://github.com/seanmcleod70/FlightDynamicsCalcs/blob/main/Aircraft%20Carrier%20Flight%20Path%20Angles.py)

Flight path angle for carrier approaches based on wind over deck, approach speed and meatball angle.

## Climb Performance

### Level Acceleration Test Technique

Examples of processing flight test data collected during a level acceleration test to determine climb performance.

#### [Level Acceleration - Energy Height - iLevil](https://github.com/seanmcleod70/FlightDynamicsCalcs/blob/main/Level%20Acceleration%20-%20Energy%20Height%20-%20iLevil.py)

#### [Level Acceleration - Energy Height - Dynon](https://github.com/seanmcleod70/FlightDynamicsCalcs/blob/main/Level%20Acceleration%20-%20Energy%20Height%20-%20Dynon.py)

#### [Level Acceleration - Nigel Speedy](https://github.com/seanmcleod70/FlightDynamicsCalcs/blob/main/Level%20Acceleration%20-%20Nigel%20Speedy.py)

### Trim Envelope

#### [Trim Envelope](https://github.com/seanmcleod70/FlightDynamicsCalcs/blob/main/Trim%20Envelope.py)

Calculate the set of trim points for an aircraft over a range of airspeeds and range of flight path angles. The required thrust and AoA is indicated for each trim point.

## VTOL

#### [VTOL Take-off Failure Options](https://github.com/seanmcleod70/FlightDynamicsCalcs/blob/main/VTOL%20Take-off%20Failure%20Options.py)

Looking at some of the options in terms of engine failure(s) during a vertical take-off of an aircraft like the Pegasus Vertical Business Jet (VBJ).

## Thrust Vectoring

#### [Thrust Vectoring Analysis](https://github.com/seanmcleod70/FlightDynamicsCalcs/blob/main/Thrust%20Vectoring%20Analysis.py)

Use JSBSim to compare how varying the thrust vector angle can minimize fuel burn for a given flight condition and compare the results to the 
NASA report - [Optimal Pitch Thrust-Vector Angle and Benefits for all Flight Regimes](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20000034897/downloads/20000034897.pdf).

## Flight Test Techniques

#### [Rudder Kick](https://github.com/seanmcleod70/FlightDynamicsCalcs/blob/main/Rudder%20Kick.py)

Simulate a pilot performing a rudder kick test by inputing a rudder input based on a ramp input. Aileron input is also included to maintain a steady heading sideslip (SHSS). The time histories of the control inputs and beta (sideslip angle) are plotted.

## Atmosphere

#### [International Standard Atmosphere](https://github.com/seanmcleod70/FlightDynamicsCalcs/blob/main/International%20Standard%20Atmosphere.py)

Calculate the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) temperature, pressure, density and speed of sound at a given altitude.
