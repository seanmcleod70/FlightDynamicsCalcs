# Flight Dynamics Calcs
Calculations, simulations with JSBSim and write up with [marimo](https://marimo.io/) notebooks.

Static html snapshots of each marimo notebook can be found in the `docs` directory and via Github
Pages at [Flight Dynamics Calcs](https://seanmcleod70.github.io/FlightDynamicsCalcs/).
