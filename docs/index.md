## Roll Performance

### [A4 Skyhawk Roll Performance](A4SkyhawkRollPerformance.html)

Can the A4 really roll at 720 deg/s or is it a tall tale? Using some aerodynamic data published by NASA let's take a look.

### [Fighter Roll Rates](FighterRollRates.html)

Comparing fighter roll rates based on published aerodynamic data.
 
## Aircraft Carrier

### [Aircraft Carrier Flight Path Angles](AircraftCarrierFlightPathAngles.html)

Flight path angle for carrier approaches based on wind over deck, approach speed and meatball angle.

## Climb Performance using Level Acceleration Test Technique

Examples of processing flight test data collected during a level acceleration test to determine climb performance.
