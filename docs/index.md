Calculations, simulations with JSBSim and write up with Marimo notebooks

Marimo notebooks available in the [Flight Dynamics Calcs repo](https://github.com/seanmcleod70/FlightDynamicsCalcs).

## Roll Performance

#### [A4 Skyhawk Roll Performance](A4SkyhawkRollPerformance.html)

Can the A4 really roll at 720 deg/s or is it a tall tale? Using some aerodynamic data published by NASA let's take a look.

#### [Fighter Roll Rates](FighterRollRates.html)

Comparing fighter roll rates based on published aerodynamic data.
 
## Aircraft Carrier

#### [Aircraft Carrier Flight Path Angles](AircraftCarrierFlightPathAngles.html)

Flight path angle for carrier approaches based on wind over deck, approach speed and meatball angle.

## Climb Performance 

### Level Acceleration Test Technique

Examples of processing flight test data collected during a level acceleration test to determine climb performance.

#### [Level Acceleration - Energy Height - iLevil](LevelAccelerationEnergyHeightiLevil.html)

#### [Level Acceleration - Energy Height - Dynon](LevelAccelerationEnergyHeightDynon.html)

#### [Level Acceleration - Nigel Speedy](LevelAccelerationNigelSpeedy.html)

### Trim Envelope

#### [Trim Envelope](TrimEnvelope.html)

Calculate the set of trim points for an aircraft over a range of airspeeds and range of flight path angles. The required thrust and AoA is indicated for each trim point.

## VTOL

#### [VTOL Take-off Failure Options](VTOLTake-offFailureOptions.html)

Looking at some of the options in terms of engine failure(s) during a vertical take-off of an aircraft like the Pegasus Vertical Business Jet (VBJ).

## Thrust Vectoring

#### [Thrust Vectoring Analysis](ThrustVectoringAnalysis.html)

Use JSBSim to compare how varying the thrust vector angle can minimize fuel burn for a given flight condition and compare the results to the 
NASA report - [Optimal Pitch Thrust-Vector Angle and Benefits for all Flight Regimes](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20000034897/downloads/20000034897.pdf).

## Flight Test Techniques

#### [Rudder Kick](RudderKick.html)

Simulate a pilot performing a rudder kick test by inputing a rudder input based on a ramp input. Aileron input is also included to maintain a steady heading sideslip (SHSS). The time histories of the control inputs and beta (sideslip angle) are plotted.
